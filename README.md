# Termix
- type safety observable store which favors simple functions and immutable pattern for updating the state
- favors using classes as a state storage since classes have a type
- favors immutable pattern - modern frameworks can take advantage of this (comparison by reference)
- group your stores (TermixStore) or use separately (Termix)
- type inference works!
